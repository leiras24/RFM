# RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) Analysis
In this project, our goal is to categorize customers based on their purchasing behavior and determine:
- Which customer segments we should focus on
- What strategies we can implement to maximize value from each group

Although the analysis was conducted using a fictional database, it demonstrates how RFM analysis can guide customer retention, targeted marketing, and resource allocation strategies.
